<h1>Work in progress...</h1>
<p>A testing ground for a future engine called lol.blocks.engine. 
The engine will be in c++ and invoked from a powershell script. 
Everything is rendered in blocks (minecraft cubes) with adjustable scaling(hardware dependent). 
The idea is to use scripting to make drawing graphics and interactions(physics) easier and fun.
